# **Unity 6 Multiplayer Webinar Game Sample**

This is the first Unity 6 project used on [the Accelerate your multiplayer prototyping](https://unity.com/resources/accelerate-your-multiplayer-prototyping-with-unity-6) webinar delivered on August of 2024, as part of [Unity's Multiplayer Summer](https://unity.com/blog/games/multiplayer-summer).

## **Features:** 
  * Simple use of client-side movement of player characters
  * Simple multiplayer gameplay, spawning enemies and bullets with basic physics trigger collisions
  * Basic lobby session management using Unity 6's Multiplayer Widgets, which uses the Multiplayer Services SDK

## **Requirements:** 
 - Unity Version [**6000.0.24f1**](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download) or newer

---------------
## **Services implemented:**
  * [Netcode for GameObjects](https://unity.com/products/netcode) :
    >This library is used to synchronize GameObject and game state data across all clients that connect in a networking session

  * [Multiplayer Center](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/multiplayer-center.html):
    >The Multiplayer Center provides a starting point to create a multiplayer game. It recommends Unity multiplayer packages based on the needs of your game, and gives you access to samples and tutorials to help you use them.

  * [Multiplayer Widgets](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.multiplayer.widgets@1.0/manual/get-started-learn-widgets.html)
    > Use multiplayer widgets to test specific stages of the Multiplayer Sessions workflow. Each multiplayer widget implements features of the Multiplayer Sessions package that uses the session SDK to group users together.
